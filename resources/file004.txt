article 4: the importance of software testing. software testing is a vital part of the development process, aimed at ensuring the quality and reliability of applications. it helps identify errors and defects early in the development cycle, significantly reducing the cost of fixing them later. there are several types of testing: unit, integration, system, regression, and user acceptance testing. automating testing with tools like selenium or junit speeds up the process and increases accuracy. thorough testing leads to the release of stable and secure products that meet user expectations and market requirements.
